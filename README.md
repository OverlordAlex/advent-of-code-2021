# Advent Of Code 2021
Doing advent of code in different languages.

For each language:
* Opinion
* Difficulty of use for task
* Installing and Running

# Fortran
Wait, I have to leave 6 spaces at the start of lines because of PUNCH CARDS. Absolutely delightful
Fortran doesn't have dynamic memory (go figure), so we really have to stream the file
Installing gfortran on a mac was awful, but only because it required xcode, and xcode required a whole new OS upgrade. Once installed compiling and running was a breeze.
