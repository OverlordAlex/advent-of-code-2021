# Advent Of Code 2021
Doing advent of code in different languages.

For each language:
* Opinion
* Difficulty of use for task
* Installing and Running

# Day 1 - Fortran (https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran)
Wait, I have to leave 6 spaces at the start of lines because of PUNCH CARDS. How quaint! Absolutely delightful! I'm not sure why I'm so charmed by this

Fortran doesn't have dynamic memory (go figure), so we really have to stream the file.

Installing gfortran on a mac was awful, but only because it required xcode, and xcode required a whole new OS upgrade. Once installed compiling and running was a breeze.
